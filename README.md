# 🛠️ V6 Engine CAD Modeling

This project features a detailed 3D CAD model of a **V6 internal combustion engine**, created using **SolidWorks**. The goal was to understand the internal mechanics and motion of engine components through precise modeling and simulation.

## 🔧 Key Features

* ✅ **Complete 3D CAD Model**: Designed a fully detailed model of a V6 engine with accurately dimensioned components.
* ⚙️ **Assembly of Key Parts**: Included pistons, crankshaft, camshaft, valves, and timing gears, all assembled using correct mechanical mates and constraints.
* 🎞️ **Motion Simulation**: Used SolidWorks Motion Study to simulate dynamic engine operation, visualizing piston-crankshaft interaction and valve timing.

## 📂 Tools Used

* **SolidWorks 2025**
